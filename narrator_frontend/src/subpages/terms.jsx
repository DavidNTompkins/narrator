 This used to have playnarrator.com's terms and conditions. This game is now open source, CC0 1.0 Universal. That is to say, use it however you want, but I take no responsibility for what you do with it. It might be broken, there might be issues, etc.
 
 Some heads ups: This game requires api keys for a few services. It might rack up charges - You are responsible for those.

 If you reach out to me on the discord or twitter, I'll try to help if I can. Thanks for playing!
